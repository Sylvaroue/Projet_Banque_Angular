# ProjetBanque

This project aims to provide bank users a tool to help managing their budget.
The whole concept is to simulate the evolution of an account's balance when operations (incomes, spendings) are applied.

The application's features are the following :
* login with a user's profile and change its properties
* access the list of accounts after login

  after selecting an account :
* get automatically the balance at the end of the month and the end of the year
* add or delete an operation
* add an operation repeated each month at the same date

This repository contains the Frontend part of the project. The associated Backend can be found in the repository : "Projet_Banque".
